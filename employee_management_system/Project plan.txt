I have planned small checkpoints to make this project
First setup virtual environment
Next create django project and application
After that create the files we want
Configure admin page and database for the project
Make modules in models.py files
After that run the server
Next Configure html files,views and urls
Next I have used JavaScripts and run the project and solve the errors
This is how I have planned and executed the project
